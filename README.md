# odin-recipes

## Introduction
This project is about building a basic recipe website using HTML.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have:
- Learned how to create links to other pages and create ordered and unordered lists.
- Improved my ability to use completed pages to help create others.
- Practiced using Git and Github for version control.

## Reflection
I still need to keep practicing with directory creation and navigation on the VS Code intergrated terminal.
